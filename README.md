Tip Calculator 💸🍽️-

Welcome to the Tip Calculator! A simple Python program that allows users to calculate how much tip they should give based on the bill amount and the percentage they choose.

Whether you're dining out, or splitting a bill with friends, this calculator makes it easy to determine the perfect tip! 💡✨

Features:

1. Calculate tip based on the bill amount and custom percentage.
2. Split the bill among multiple people 👥.
3. Easy-to-use interface with simple prompts for user input.
4. Clear and user-friendly output, showing both the total amount and per person cost.

   
🛠️ How to Run:

1.) Clone the repository or download the Python file (tip_calculator.py).
 ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tip-calculator.git
```

2.) Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
```bash
cd tip-calculator
```

3.) Run the Python script.
```bash
python tip_calculator.py
```

4.) Follow the prompts to enter the total bill, tip percentage, and the number of people to split the bill.


📄 Example Usage:

1. You will be prompted to input the total bill amount.
2. Then, you choose the tip percentage (e.g., 15%, 20%, etc.).
3. Finally, you enter how many people are splitting the bill.
   
The program will then calculate and display:

* The total tip amount.
* The total amount after adding the tip.
* The amount each person needs to pay if you're splitting the bill.

🧑‍💻 Code Example:
```bash
# Sample Output:
# Enter the total bill amount: 100
# Enter the tip percentage (e.g., 15, 20): 20
# How many people are splitting the bill? 4

# Total bill: 100
# Tip (20%): 20
# Total amount (including tip): 120
# Each person pays: 30
```

💡 Features to Add (Coming Soon!):

# Ability to round up the tip to nearest dollar.
# Support for custom bill categories (e.g., food, drinks, tax).
# Save calculation history for reference.


🔧 Requirements:

Python 3.x
